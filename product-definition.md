# 1.0 Queensland Government Website Standards
The Queensland Government’s [Information Standard 26 (IS26)](http://github.com) policy states that all public-facing Queensland Government websites must comply with the appropriate website standard.

The standards are:
* Franchise Website Standard (also known as SWE)
* Agency Website Standard (also known as the Consistent User Experience or ‘CUE’).

This document will assist agencies to understand and comply with the Franchise Website Standard.  
## 1.1	The Franchise Website Standard 

The Franchise Website Standard helps agencies contribute to a franchise model for Queensland Government online service delivery. The objective of the model is to make it easier for customers to interact with the Queensland Government by organising all citizen-facing content in a customer-centric rather than agency-centric way. This means that each franchise delivers online content for a specific topic or audience.

All Queensland Government franchise websites need to adhere to a set of guidelines that provide customers with a **single website experience (SWE)**. These guidelines form a template of technical components for use by government departments. 

This document:  
*	outlines the requirements for developing website components 
*	helps departments customise the components for their specific audience. 
The One-Stop Shop Strategy and Implementation Office (OSSSIO) is committed to meeting customers’ needs by optimising their online experience. The requirements included in this document have been developed in consultation with a wide range of stakeholders (including members of the User Interface and Mobile Applications Community of Practice) and tested by customer focus groups. 

A franchise owner may determine that their audience would benefit from a variation to a particular requirement. To request a variation, contact OSSSIO by emailing oss.products@dsiti.qld.gov.au.
