# 1.0 Queensland Government Website Standards
The Queensland Government’s [Information Standard 26 (IS26)](http://github.com) policy states that all public-facing Queensland Government websites must comply with the appropriate website standard.

The standards are:
* Franchise Website Standard (also known as SWE)
* Agency Website Standard (also known as the Consistent User Experience or ‘CUE’).

This document will assist agencies to understand and comply with the Franchise Website Standard.  
## 1.1	The Franchise Website Standard 

The Franchise Website Standard helps agencies contribute to a franchise model for Queensland Government online service delivery. The objective of the model is to make it easier for customers to interact with the Queensland Government by organising all citizen-facing content in a customer-centric rather than agency-centric way. This means that each franchise delivers online content for a specific topic or audience.

All Queensland Government franchise websites need to adhere to a set of guidelines that provide customers with a **single website experience (SWE)**. These guidelines form a template of technical components for use by government departments. 

This document:  
*	outlines the requirements for developing website components 
*	helps departments customise the components for their specific audience. 

The One-Stop Shop Strategy and Implementation Office (OSSSIO) is committed to meeting customers’ needs by optimising their online experience. The requirements included in this document have been developed in consultation with a wide range of stakeholders (including members of the User Interface and Mobile Applications Community of Practice) and tested by customer focus groups. 

A franchise owner may determine that their audience would benefit from a variation to a particular requirement. To request a variation, contact OSSSIO by emailing oss.products@dsiti.qld.gov.au.

# 2.0 Accessibility

The Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Cwlth) states that all Australian websites must comply with the [W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0](https://www.w3.org). Queensland Government websites and websites established or commissioned by Queensland Government bodies, extranets and internet applications are also specifically mandated in IS26 to achieve conformance Level AA of these guidelines.

Note: Some agencies may require WCAG AAA Level conformance (e.g. Department of Communities, Child Safety and Disability Services). Refer to your agency’s web policy or procedure for guidelines on your conformance requirements. 

WCAG 2.0 also provides specific requirements for Rich Internet Applications. It allows for a baseline technology to be set by the site creator (e.g. JavaScript) but does not remove the responsibility of meeting success criteria (e.g. the JavaScript **must** be made accessible).

Refer to [WAI Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/) for more information.
